# Data-Analysis-of-Home-Prices-in-California-1990-
I used a public dataset from Kaggle, Data Analysis of House Prices in California from 1990, to determine a link between prices and a number of variables, create a dashboard, and present major findings.

Information
The information is based on the 1990 census and includes some summary statistics about the homes located in a specific California district. Be advised the data aren't cleansed thus there are some preprocessing procedures required! The columns are as follows, their titles are relatively self explanitory:

1. longitude
2. latitude
3. housing_median_age
4. total_rooms
5. total_bedrooms
6. population
7. households
8. median_income
9. median_house_value
10. ocean_proximity
